Hello Everyone, I am really excited to share with you something really cool today. It is my new report of the project that I was part of: Generate Insights to Solve a Supply Chain Issue in the FMCG domain by CodeBasics.



It really helped me to gain very good knowledge about different fields of the industry. Let me take you through the project





Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.





AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.





More than 96% percent of items were delivered.

Amongst the cities, Surat was on top in which Items were delivered on time.

AM Milk was most delivered before the target date.

VOFR% is almost same for all the items.

AM Milk was the most bought items of all.

Most items were ordered in the month of May.







Business-related terms that I learnt:
